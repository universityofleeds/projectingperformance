  <p class="style2">Dancing in the Streets: Interactive play and digital performance </p>
  <p align="left" class="style1">In January 2005, performance academics
      at the University of Leeds and technologists at KMA Creative Technologies
      Ltd came together with an idea to get the people of York dancing in the
      streets.&nbsp; The idea consisted of a projected light
    installation on a street corner that would encourage passers-by to &lsquo;dance&rsquo;,
    through physical interaction with the digitised projections.&nbsp; The resulting
    experiment surpassed our original expectations, in achieving an installation
    that spanned both art and game aesthetics, and that became a regular stopping
    point for shoppers, clubbers and party-goers to engage in danced activities
  in the city streets.</p>
  <p align="left" class="style1"><br>
    <em>Dancing in the Streets</em> opened on March 11th 2005 with a performance
      by University of Leeds dance students which launched both the installation
      and the York Festival of Science and Technology. The installation took
      the form of a kinetic light sculpture, that continuously morphed as it
      responded to the positioning and movements of bodies within the space.
      The pavement became the canvas for this interactive urban scenography,
      which enticed passers-by into a hitherto deserted square off Davygate in
      York&rsquo;s city centre. The heat from participant&rsquo;s bodies in the
      space was detected through&nbsp; an infrared camera (misappropriated military
      hardware) which provided the input for the digital images which.. were
      projected from above onto the pavement., A range of images were provided
      for the public to interact with and these included&nbsp; swarms of butterflies
      which clustered and appeared to attach themselves to each person,, footprints
      that followed participants around the square and more abstract arrangements
      of shapes, lines and ribbons. Pierre Chassereau's 1750 map of York was
      also used so that participants could fleetingly uncover aspects of the
      historic city by leaving trails of light across the floor.&nbsp; A game
      of &lsquo;football&rsquo; using balls of light became one of the highlights
      of the installation and encouraged competitive team play The installation
      remained at the location from March to June 2005, where it was discovered
    and regularly revisited by York&rsquo;s inhabitants.</p>
    <p align="left" class="style1"><br>The research focus of this project was two-fold.&nbsp; We were seeking authentically
    interactive processes in both the design of the installation and the participants&rsquo; experiences
    of it. Notions of play heavily influenced both the way in which we worked,
    and the product that emerged. Beryl Graham suggests that interactive arts
    require skills &lsquo;perhaps less like the traditional art skills, and more
    like the social interaction skills of &ldquo;throwing a good party&rdquo;&rsquo; (1996,
    p.171). These types of skills became apparent as we sought to involve artists,
    technologists and participants in playful activities of mutual exchange,
    arising from the intersection of aesthetic and social engagement. Games became
    part of the process almost by accident, as we played in the studio with ideas
    for how users might interact with digital projections on the floor.&nbsp; A
    spontaneous movement where one person pretended to &lsquo;kick&rsquo; the
    small round projection towards another evolved naturally within the design
    of the installation into a game of &lsquo;football&rsquo;, with scores on
    either side of the projection area. Jarvinen (2002, p.190) asserts that &lsquo;games
    do foster [&hellip;] moments when aesthetic dimensions of things rise to
    the surface&rsquo;, but in this case the opposite occurred, and the moment
    of game arose from the aesthetic situation where artists were playing with
    interactive potential. Jarvinen goes on to propose games as &lsquo;popular
    art&rsquo;, and critically he describes how &lsquo;one can play and consume
    them &ldquo;wherever&rdquo; and &ldquo;whenever&rdquo;, outside institutionalised
    practices&rsquo; (ibid).&nbsp; In our aim to have people dancing in the streets,
    we were asking them to engage with the interactive artwork in a location
    that was neither institutionally associated with art nor even specifically
    identified as housing an artwork. There was a sense of playful discovery
    about the installation as it lay dormant in a small, unlit and neglected&nbsp; yard
    adjacent to the main street. The location with its intriguing circling lights
    brought the casual passer-by into the role of participant in the game-related
    context of &lsquo;learning&rsquo; what it was and exploring how the &lsquo;rules&rsquo; of
    engagement worked. Jarvinen&rsquo;s principles that games foster aesthetic
    dimensions then functioned as he suggests; as the participant discovered
    the rules, the aesthetic dimension became apparent through the interaction
    between physical movement and digital projection response.</p>
    <p align="left" class="style1">Popat has proposed elsewhere that &lsquo;in a truly interactive work nobody,
    not even the designer or the performer, can predict the outcome&rsquo; (2002,
    p.221). Interactivity is the product of communication where mutual engagement
    results in unpredictability, often arising out of playful spontaneity. This
    was evident in the creative process for this installation, which began with
    a general idea of animated digital projections on the pavement reacting to
    physical motion of participants, sensed through an infrared camera. Nothing
    was fixed, and the artists and technologists experimented freely with possibilities
    and ideas. Kit Monkman, Director of KMA, described this process as &lsquo;creative
    freedom&rsquo; and &lsquo;an extraordinary, valuable way of collaborating
    on projects&rsquo; that was usually unavailable in the commercial world due
    to the pressures to produce.&nbsp; Here was a clear sense of intersection
    between different fields of knowledge that led to the devising of something
    that grew iteratively out of dialogue and exchange. <br>
    The product that emerged from this interactive process was reliant upon digital
    technologies that produced a framework of possibilities, with which the participant
    could interact. Was it therefore, by default, a less interactive experience?
    Robert Wechsler of Palindrome argues that digital interactivity is often
    characterised by &lsquo;automation, not interaction&rsquo;.&nbsp; He explains
    that:<br>
    Interaction implies a back-and-forth of energy and impulse between artists
    or between artist, artwork and audience &ndash; not simply one isolated action
    triggering another. (http://www.palindrome.de/)<br>
    <p class="style1">We were envisaging an artwork in which the audience would be the performers,
    without even realising it.&nbsp; The images were selected and modified to
    establish key ways in which they would respond to human interaction. They
    were fixed in terms of their behavioural response, range of colour, and the
    order in which they appeared to the audience, but each image had a fluidity
    as it was constantly responding to the input from participants.&nbsp; The
    overall aesthetic of the artwork was therefore carefully controlled providing
    artistic cohesion and form. However, crucially the ways in which the audience
    could interact with these images were not fully prescribed, but existed within
    a framework that included potential for significant variability and even
    surprise within the rules of engagement. KMA describe how their work is &lsquo;rooted
    in the modelling of the physics of nature, using the mathematics of swarm
    behaviours, springs and masses, cellular automata and chaos.&rsquo; (http://www.kma.co.uk)
    The chaotic elements existed within the clearly defined broad framework that
    enabled the existence of rules within which to play, but it brought a level
    of fluidity and spontaneity that made the piece inter-active rather than
    automatically re-active.&nbsp; The butterflies that flocked around participants&rsquo; feet
    would fly away out of the projection if they were unable to keep up with
    the participant&rsquo;s movement. The ghostly feet, whilst following the
    participants&rsquo; pathways, would dictate their own routes to a degree.&nbsp; Equally,
    participants brought their own independent choices and modes of engagement
    to the work, as they discovered the rules and worked out how they wished
    to interact with them. Participants could step in and out of the light source,
    selecting the images with which they wished to interact.&nbsp; (A few people
    even worked out the length of time between cycles of the &lsquo;football&rsquo; game
    and would leave and come back to participate in that element again.)&nbsp; Importantly,
    the installation was most effective when more than one person was interacting
    within it. The square space in which the light was projected, and the nature
    of the projections, encouraged social interaction. One of the images used
    purple ribbons of light to link everyone standing in the space. As participants
    moved into the space then the ribbons immediately included them in the web
    changing the projected geometric shape to accommodate the new body This instant,
    dynamic response promoted a sense of connection that was fundamental to the
    work. The &lsquo;football&rsquo; game was the most obvious form of group
    engagement, with the potential to have either individual players or multiple
    participants engaged in team play. The social side of the installation underpinned
    the early intention to have people not only dancing in the streets, but dancing <em>together</em> in
    the streets. <br>
    <p class="style1">As mentioned previously, this project challenged the concept of institutionalisation,
    appropriating a public space for the purpose of producing an artwork but
    critically failing to inform the public that this was what it was. The installation
    had been commissioned as part of the York Renaissance Project, with the two-fold
    requirement that it address perception of behaviour induced by urban living,
    and respond to the specific regeneration need of energising York city centre
    at night. The little square had been a dead space, both literally and figuratively,
    as it sat empty between two buildings and was the site of an old graveyard.
    This installation filled the space with light and activity, having a transformative
    impact at a local and regional level. Lefebvre suggests that &lsquo;space
    commands bodies, prescribing or proscribing gestures, routes, and distances
    to be covered&rsquo; (1974, trans Nicholson-Smith, 1991, p.143). By (mis)appropriating
    the space and changing its perception for its users, the installation overcame
    the prescription that Lefebvre describes and energized an otherwise transitional
    shopping/walking thoroughfare as a place of meeting and dancing. The installation
    became an exterior extension of the pub, club and party environments of York,
    providing an aesthetically oriented diversion &ndash; a free entertainment
    that entranced night time revellers on their various journeys through the
    city,&nbsp; bringing life to the otherwise empty historic streets. <em>Dancing
    in the Streets</em> became for some an important regular detour from their
    main social activity of the evening and was particularly popular around the
    time that the bars and public houses closed. This transitional identity was
    reflected in its limited life, as the installation was dismantled in June
  2005.&nbsp;  </p>
