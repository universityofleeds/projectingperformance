Projecting Performance
======================

Projecting Performance was a collaboration between performance academics from the School of Performance &amp; Cultural Industries and digital technologists from KMA Creative Technology Ltd. This AHRC-funded project focuses on the choreographic and scenographic exchange between dancers and projected digital images within a theatrical context. It questions processes of performance and perceived boundaries between performers and technologists, and instead it promotes dialogues in an iterative cycle of creative development.

The website originally had its own domain name, but was later moved to become part of the School of Performance &amp; Cultural Industries website. When this website was moved in 2019, the projecting performance content was no longer available, and the files from the site have been archived here.
